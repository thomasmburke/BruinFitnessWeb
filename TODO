TODO:
- Add Location to footer
- update URLs by either having the navbar do rewrites or updated folder structure of webpages
- Schedule table should be ordered
- Schedule table: see if we can get shadows back -- not sure where those went..
- Schedule should have a section that is specific to holiday our callouts
- Contact page should have a map view of where the gym before the footer
- Add the arrow for click nav
- Need a way to rate limit the number of contact form submissions, potentially disable the submit button after a 3 submits?
    - Really should move rate limiting and DB write to Cloud Run for security and avoid cold start issues with GCF

Additional web pages needed:
- "Contact Us"
- Schedule
- WOD
- FAQ

Nice to have web pages / page sections:
- Location (not entirely sure this is necessary)
- Job Opportunities
- News / Events
- Blog
- Shop apparel
- Member Spotlight

Navbar needs nice to haves:
- Make dropdown look prettier (on smaller screens)
