TODO:
- Add Location to footer
- Use React Framework
- Have schedule.html pull from Firestore
- update URLs by either having the navbar do rewrites or updated folder structure of webpages

Additional web pages needed:
- "Contact Us"
- Schedule
- WOD
- FAQ

Nice to have web pages / page sections:
- Location (not entirely sure this is necessary)
- News / Events
- Blog
- Shop apparel
- Member Spotlight

Navbar needs nice to haves:
- Make dropdown look prettier (on smaller screens)
