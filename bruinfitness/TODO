- make navbar navlinks active when currently being used (looks like I need withRouter: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62721457/react-bootstrap-change-link-of-navbar-to-active)
- make the reservation upper limit a Firestore document instead of being hardcoded (added a constants collection now I just have to read it)
- make admin nav item appear for admins (awaiting actual PR to reactfire github)
- create admin error component
- Ensure there is an alert sent to an admin if one of the next 3 days doesn't have workout programming assigned to it yet

WorkoutTab bugs and action items:
- WorkoutTab defaults to selecting metcon, might want this to be more sophisticated
- if a workout tab is selected and the date changes and that workout type doesn't exists than nothing is selected
- Empty Progamming is not centered on tablet sized screens (nice to have)


Data Model:
- when adding workouts for the week the fitness programmer will select the day in the UI
they will then write out all the workout details this will get written to the workouts collection
under that day
- fitness programmer will also be responsible for adding the classes for the week.
They will check checkboxes to add the ones that are needed for the week. (or should be removed)
by default certain check boxes will be enabled, but the programmer can add additional classes for a week and remove others
